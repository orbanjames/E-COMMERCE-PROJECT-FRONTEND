## 📦 Overview

E‑COMMERCE‑PROJECT‑FRONTEND is a modern, responsive frontend application for an online shop. It provides users with the ability to browse products, view product details, manage a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. The frontend is built to integrate with a backend API (or mock data), offering an end‑to‑end shopping experience from product discovery to order placement.

### 🎯 Features

- Product listing with grid or list layout  
- Product detail pages with images, description, price, etc.  
- Search and filtering (by category, price, etc.)  
- Shopping cart: add, update quantity, remove items  
- Checkout page (or placeholder) / Order confirmation flow  
- Responsive UI for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices  
- Client-side routing for seamless navigation (home, product pages, cart, checkout)  
- (Optional) User authentication & account pages — login / signup / order history *(if implemented)*  
- (Optional) Wishlist or favorites feature *(if implemented)*
